# About

I am a Software Engineer with a passion for solving complex problems and an aspiration to become an engineer involved in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing. I currently work at Fidelity National Information Services where I am a SME (Subject Matter Expert) of Sisense. Sisense is a Business Intelligence product under FIS's Wealth and Management project that compiles client data and presents it in an scalable and organized manner. 

My responsibilities include:
- Developing features and enhancements for Sisense using C#, ASP.net, API's and other web technologies
- Designing Sisense reports from a front-end perspective and implementing it in code
- Optimizing queries for transfering data from FIS's database to Sisense's data containers called Elasticubes
- Creating a proof-of-concept for the Linux Version of Sisense and writing a runbook for its deployment to performance testing servers
- Troubleshooting and resolving bugs in production


I have a Bachelor's Degree with a Major in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics from CUNY Hunter College.

During my time at Hunter College, I gained experience using C++ for Data Structures and Algorithms and other Computer Science fundamentals.
My coursework also involved programming in C for Computer Architecture and Unix Tools, and LISP for my Artificial Intelligence course. 

I completed Java Full Stack training with Quintrix Solutions using Java, J2EE and the Spring MVC framework.
I am also self-taught in Python and JavaScript related technologies such as HTML, CSS and NodeJS.
