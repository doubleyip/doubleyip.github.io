# About

Aspiring Software Engineer with a passion for solving complex problems through the use of topics such as Algorithms and Machine Learning. 
Self-starter with a drive to use the most efficient technology stack or tools for the job and the adaptability to learn them straightaway. 
Specializes in back-end technology such as C++, Python and TensorFlow, while also having experience in front-end development.
Currently, I am excited to become a Full Stack Engineer and one day hope to develop apps using Artifical Intelligence, Natural Language Process and Machine Learning. 

I have a Bachelor's Degree with a Major in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics from CUNY Hunter College.

During my time at Hunter College I gained experience using C++ for Data Structures and Algorithms and other Computer Science fundamentals.
My coursework also involved programming in C for Computer Architecture and Unix Tools, and LISP for my Artificial Intelligence course. 

I completed Java Full Stack training with Quintrix Solutions using Java, J2EE and the Spring MVC framework.
I am also self-taught in Python and JavaScript related technologies.
