# About

I am an aspiring Software Engineer with a passion for solving complex problems through the use of topics such as Algorithms and Machine Learning. 
I am a self-starter with a drive to use the most efficient technology stack or tools for the job and the adaptability to learn them straightaway. 
Currently, I am excited to become a Full Stack Engineer and one day hope to develop apps using Artifical Intelligence and Natural Language Process. 

I have a Bachelor's Degree with a Major in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics from CUNY Hunter College.

During my time at Hunter College, I gained experience using C++ for Data Structures and Algorithms and other Computer Science fundamentals.
My coursework also involved programming in C for Computer Architecture and Unix Tools, and LISP for my Artificial Intelligence course. 

I completed Java Full Stack training with Quintrix Solutions using Java, J2EE and the Spring MVC framework.
I am also self-taught in Python and JavaScript related technologies such as HTML, CSS and NodeJS.
