### About the Stock Portfolio App
 
The Stock Portfolio App was developed for the final round of the interview process for the NYC Tech Talent Pipeline (TTP). 
Users can sign up and buy and sell stocks using real time data from the IEX Api. The app is built using NodeJS and Express 
while the Request interface is used for the API calls. CSS and JavaScript are used for the Front End.
The user database is built using calls from NodeJS to MySQL.
